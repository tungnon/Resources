    <h5>What are Advent Stages?</h5>
    <p>
        Advent stages are stages that run twice a month and drop useful units. These are considerably tough compared to
        other stages around their level of progression, and feature special boss enemies, exclusive to these stages.
    </p>

    <h5>Why should I beat Advent Stages?</h5>
    <p>
        Advents drop some of the best cats in the game, with very unique roles that are almost irreplaceable at what
        they do. Examples of these include Slime, Bullet Train, and Green Shell, among many others.
    </p>
		
    <h5>When should I start doing Advent Stages?</h5>
    <p>
        There isn’t exactly a ‘correct’ time to start doing advent stages, but it’s normally recommended to start them
        in mid-SoL; after you have important Gacha rare / super rare True Forms and Awakened Bahamut.
    </p>
		
    <h5>What order should I do Advent Stages in?</h5>
    <p>
        Look at advent stages as and when they come, and see if you’re prepared enough to beat them. If you can’t tell,
        then ask someone in help channels or the subreddit. There is no well-defined order to do advents in. A lot of
        them are heavily dependent on a certain gacha cat, and not having that could delay how late into the game you
        can beat it. Specific uber rare cats also completely nullify the challenge of some advents, so keep an eye out
        for those too. That being said, the general order of advent difficulty is:
    </p>
		
    <p>
        Bakoo < Queen B < Hannya = Daboo < Clionel = Wahwah < Doremi < Papuu < Okame = Emperor < Puffsley < Wanwan = Queen Mother V = Kappy < Z-Onel
    </p>

    <h5>How do I do Advent Stages?</h5>
    <p>Well that’s why this guide exists. Let’s get right into it. But first...</p>

    <div class="callout callout-danger">
        <h5>A disclaimer on Unit Levels</h5>
        <p>
            Going through these guides, you might find that the guidemaker's levels do not exactly match yours. It's
            common to see them use an overlevelled Eraser or Manic Lion and yours isn't quite that high. If the guide
            uses a Level 34 Awakened Bahamut or a Level 32 Psychocat, it's pretty well understood that Level 30 should
            be sufficient. I tried to balance levels a bit on my own end while making this, but you might run into some
            oddballs anyway. 5~10 levels here and there can be typically compensated for by some other means. That being
            said, guidemakers tend to be rather conservative in this regard, so your levels will most likely be higher
            than those in the guide.
        </p>

	<h2 id="queen-b">Queen B</h2>
	<hr>


    <h4 id="honey-trap">Queen's Coronation > Honey Trap</h4>

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Queen B stands at 999 range with 888~1332 LD. She inflicts Guaranteed permaslow and has a 3.3s attack frequency,
        with 12k damage per attack. You need at least 9 speed to enter her blindspot [unless you're luring]. She is
        Alien / Floating.
    </p>
	
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>The stage contains Queen B paired with The Sloth. Peons include occasional Brollow waves and Kroxos.</p>
	
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Awakened Bahamut is perfect for this stage. With high speed and solid DPS, he'll
            be your primary source of damage. A crucial part of all rush strats.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sadako</b> - Serves as a wall that stops Brollows from killing your higher range units. Great unit to
            bring
            even if you're not rushing.
        </li>
    </ul>
	
    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Butterly / Fish-Man</b> - Can one-shot Brollows, and deals good damage to Queen B. High speed lets her
            enter Queen B's blindspot easily. Also decent for chipping other enemies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can, preferably with Speed Up</b> - Damage output is good for cleaning up all kinds of peons, and
            contributes in rush strat as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Castaway / Seafarer / Necromancer</b> - Can freeze Queen B, making it easy for other units to enter her
            blind spot.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Magica / Thaumaturge</b> - Might weaken The Sloth, allowing your Bahamut to survive a hit from it. With
            that
            it's possible to rush Queen B in just one Bahamut chain.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Anti-Floating / Anti-Traitless / Generalist Rushers:</b> Meow-sketeer / Valiant D'arktanyan,
            Li'l Valkyrie / Li'l Valkyrie Dark, Divine Kalisa, etc.
        </li>
        <li><b>Certain Slow-Immunes:</b> High-Lord Babel, Strike Unit R.E.I., Rock Revengers / One-Hit Wonders.</li>
        <li><b>Generalist Tankers:</b> Divine Kai, Hades the Deathdealer, Cats in the Cradle</li>
    </ul>
	
    <h5>Lineups and Strategies</h5>
    <div class="callout callout-info">
        Note that it is possible to beat Queen B without rushing, if relying on boosted units / True Forms / Ubercarry;
        but that is not mentioned here. It can also require timing which may take some practice, and the rush approach
        is usually considered better.
    </div>

    <p><b><u>General Rush Strat</u></b></p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write(lineup(['30-1-36', '30-1-33', '30-1-199', '30-1-100', '30-2-25', '20-2-92', '30-1-198', '30-1-52', '30-2-149', '30-2-32']))

    <p>
        Maiden's Defense combo is optional, you can use other appropriate units for the filler slot. This lineup also
        uses Cameraman for damaging Queen B / Brollows / Kroxos.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lure Queen B to the base, then start stacking Cameraman / Sadako / Butterfly / Can Can / etc. on her. After the
        first Knockback, deploy Bahamut. This mostly leads to a consistent chain. Freeze from Necromancer / Necro-Dancer
        and Castaway / Seafarer makes a clean entry for your other units. Weakening The Sloth with Magica can allow your
        Bahamut to tank a hit from it, but this isn't absolutely necessary.
    </p>


    <h4 id = "honey-drip">Queen's Condemnation > Honey Drip</h4>

    <h5>Stage Restriction</h5>
    <p>Cost <= 3900. The consequence of this is that you cannot use Awakened Bahamut [or normal-price Ubers]</p>

    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Catellite</b> - Since the approach here is to outlast the Brollow waves, having Catellite for stalling is
            a high priority.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sadako / Octopus</b> - Serves as a wall that stops Brollows from killing your higher range units. Great
            unit to bring especially since you're not rushing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fish-Man</b> - Can one-shot Brollows, and deals good damage to Queen B. Great for chipping almost every
            enemy on this stage. Thanks to high speed, it can make it into Queen B's blindspot without needing too much
            timing.
        </li>
    </ul>
	
    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can, preferably with Speed Up</b> - Damage output is good for cleaning up all kinds of peons,
            although performance without speed up isn't very remarkable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Maglev</b> - Kills a single peon, and gives double bounty. Good to stop Queen B from pushing just after
            The Sloth attacks, and reduces pressure during Brollow waves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Vendor</b> - Can knockback The Sloth, helping you to recover ground.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ubers with <=3900 Cost and Decent Speed:</b> Gigavolta, Divine Twinstars, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Lineups and Strategies</h5>
    <p><b><u>BioBone Strat</u></b></p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write(lineup(['30-2-19', '30-2-11', '30-2-52', '20-1-4', '30-1-145', '30-2-376', '30-2-33', '30-2-36', '30-2-32', '30-1-284']))
    </script>
    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/pQdLl-3lTuk" target="_blank">Video</a></p>
    <p>
        The Speed combo is optional, and doesn't do a whole lot, so I removed it in the video. Use Vendor instead if you
        want to, or a 2-Slot health / defense / speed combo. The purpose of most units is the same as the previous
        stage, except this approach relies very heavily on Catellite and Fish-man.
    </p>
	
    <p>
        Stall Queen B on the enemy base with Catellite and Fish-man, till the first Brollow wave. Lure the Brollows to
        the base, and send basically everything at them. Once this is done, The Sloth should be behind Queen B; and your
        units will knock back Queen B. At this point try and get Worker Cat to ~level 6, and play defensively. Catellite
        spam is great, send Fish-man as he recharges. Octopus and Can Can can be sent less frequently. Reserve Maglev to
        retain your ground when The Sloth attacks / for Brollow waves. After the first two-three waves the Brollows die
        down, and you can beat down the bosses.
    </p>


    <h4 id="royal-jelly-hell">Queen's Condemnation > Royal Jelly Hell</h4>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage contains Queen B paired Cyberhorns, Dark Otters, and Wall Doge - with all peons spawning at a
        relatively slow rate. Arguably easier than the two stages that come before it.
    </p>
		
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Awakened Bahamut is important to kill Cyberhorn before Queen B gets to your base.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Corrupted Psychocat / Seafarer</b> - Crowd Control units are important for stalling Cyberhorn. Note that
            true formed Psychocat makes a significant difference, and Freeze Up Seafarer is great here too.
            Alternatively, Can Can with Target Alien talent works too. Either of these three will be good, but bringing
            more is always welcome.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Chill Cat</b> - For busting down Cyberhorn quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bomber Cat</b> - To stop Dark Otter so your other units can kill it.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Fish-Man</b> - For rushing Queen B, preferably before having to fight the second Cyberhorn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Power Saw</b> - Same use as Chill, except does slightly better damage for it's cost. Cooldown is high
            though, so only put it in a filler slot.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Anti-Alien / Generalist Rushers:</b> Meow-sketeer / Valiant D'arktanyan, Li'l Valkyrie /
            Li'l Valkyrie Dark, Divine Kalisa, etc.
        </li>
        <li><b>Melee Units with High DPS:</b> Immortal Yukimura, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Lineups and Strategies</h5>
    <p><b><u>General Rush Strat</u></b></p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write(lineup(['30-2-19', '30-2-52', '30-2-11', '30-2-25', '30-2-199', '32-2-197', '30-2-32', '37-2-38', '32-2-36', '30-2-127']))

    <p>
        Uses BioBone to get more value out of Chill, among other units. You can also try out Crazed Wall if you have
        extra slots.
    </p>
    <p>
        Send one Fish-Man immediately [this isn't done in the video, but other guides do it and it's a good idea]. This
        will stall Queen B for a while, and buy you some time to build a stack on cyberhorn later [he'll also kill the
        first Wall Doge, which makes stacking a bit easier]. Lure Cyberhorn to base, then send everything you have on
        him. By the time Queen B arrives, Cyberhorn should be dead. Try to Cannon Cancel her attack [this isn't easy,
        so don't fret if you can't do it]. Try to get a few units into her blindspot, and attempt rush similar to the
        original stage. Bahamut should also enter her blindspot once his slow expires, which will help too.
    </p>



	<h2 id="queen-v">Queen Mother V</h2>
	<hr>


	<h4 id="ill-be-bug">The Old Queen > I'll Be Bug</h4>

	<h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>Queen Mother V, has the same range and attack frequency as Queen B, but inflicts Curse instead of Slow.</p>

	<h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        Features 2 200% Magnification Professor A spawning at a long interval, with waves of peons in between;
        consisting of Ginger Snache, Relic Doge, and One Horn. Getting hit by curse makes your anti-reds substantially
        worse against Professor A. So, some seriously good timing is required here.
    </p>

	<h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Manic Island</b> - Comes in use for chipping Professor A, killing peons, everything. Any level lower than
            40
            will struggle to survive for long enough, unless you have strong up combos.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Roe</b> - Your primary tank. You’ll use this to hold back the enemies while your other units keep coming
            and dying.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - For attacking Professor A, preferably landing multiple hits while doing so.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bullet Train</b> - For killing Ginger Snache and Relic Doge, can also be used to chip Professor A if
            needed. Great as you don’t really need to time it to work.
        </li>
    </ul>

	<h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>NEO Cutter</b> - Does the same damage as an Awakened Bahamut hit to red enemies once strengthened,
            although it doesn’t always land in a hit. 41s cooldown is half that of Bahamut, which means you get more
            opportunities when you bring both.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can</b> - Great for killing One Horn, stalling it with slow, and killing Relic Doge.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Island</b> - Works as a second M.Island. Especially good if you’re bringing Strong Up Combos.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent)</b> - Good for stalling / slow chipping if you manage to have 2 Prof. A on

            other enemies are at front.

    <p>
        BioBone is great on this stage. With Research Up M, Roe’s deployment time becomes exactly twice of Queen Mother
        V’s attack cycle. This means that once one Roe gets in her blindspot, future Roes will also get in, if you time
        them the moment they recharge. If you aren’t very good at timing, BioBone is for you. Power Cutter and Li’l
        Brave Cat have an Attack Up Sm Combo, which is great to have [for a cheap slot count].
    </p>
    <p>
        Use Cutter and Bullet Train in the startoff as shown to get some cheap damage on Professor A. Lure Queen V close
        to your base (but not hitting), wait out for a while to build up money, and then send Bahamut. Once you get 2
        KBs, the first One Horn should be in front. Beyond this point, the strat is relatively flexible. Try to get
        knockbacks on Professor A with Power Cutter / Bahamut when you can. Time your units to make sure they’re roughly
        at the same position as Roe when Queen V attacks. This will make your timings consistent. Once the first
        Professor A dies, your win is practically guaranteed.

        [Uses Rich Cat] This strat is like the previous one, with Research Up M and Strong Up Sm. It focuses on landing
        2 Bahamut hits just after Prof A.s first KB. After that, it stalls till the second Prof. A comes. Rather than
        using Bahamut to rush down the first Prof. A, it’s kept reserved for the 2x Relic Doge Wave.

        This strategy stacks Combos (Strong Up Sm + M / Defense Up Sm) to increase the value you get out of Manic
        Island. Since it lacks BioBone, it requires good timing from the player. You can bring regular Island too if
        it’s levelled enough. You could try this out if you have the monthly cats needed for the combos. See Yohane’s
        dual island version <a href="https://youtu.be/wZ1oZ0O1iJ0" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h4 id = "parade-of-the-dead">Dead on Debut > Parade of the Dead</h4>

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Daboo of the Dead is an omnistrike pusher boss, with a standing range of 300 and a maximum range of 800. He has
        an enormous 3 Million HP with just three knockbacks. On top of that, he has immunity to most status effects,
        making him a big slowly pushing wall. He deals 30000 damage every 13s, which can one-shot meatshields and a lot
        of other units. Worst of all, he inflicts a crippling 10s long Slow to anything he hits, making it more
        difficult to get to him.
    </p>
		
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        Daboo spawns almost immediately on a timer, followed by a Zroco. Enemies cycle involving Angelic and Zombie
        peons, including Heavenly Hippoe, Angelic Gory, Zory, and Zir Zeal. After 2-3 waves of both traits the peons die
        down, giving you a clear shot on Daboo.
    </p>
		
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Awakened Bahamut is very important to rush down the Angel peons, otherwise they
            can be a massive nuisance to kill.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Shigong</b> - Survives two Daboo hits, is Slow immune. Great for dealing with Zombie peons as well.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can</b> - Solid DPS, good bulk, double bounty with talents helps too.
        </li>

        BioBone makes Ramen and Shigong considerably better at their job, and also helps other units. Having Sniper goes
        a long way. The lineup looks a bit different in the video but it is effectively the same as what you see here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sniper can be kept on for the entire duration of the run. Send off a Manic Mohawk to bait a Daboo hit. Send
        meatshields and attackers at a gradual rate to build up money. When the Heavenly Hippos arrive, send Can Can and
        pretty much whatever else you have. Awakened Bahamut can be kept reserved for Heavenly Hippoe waves. Use Holy
        Blast to interrupt Daboo attacks if you have it, otherwise regular cannon works too. Try and keep a decent
        amount of money in your wallet, and fight out the peon waves. A few minutes later the peons will die down and
        you should have an easy win.

    <h5>Stage Restriction</h5>
    <p>
        Allowed Costs: >= 1200. Disallowed Costs: &lt; 1200. Since the regular strat relies heavily on Ramen and Shigong,
        this makes a massive change to your approach. Rather than relying on meatshields to hold the front line, you'll
        need Titans or Ubers.

        Due to the nature of this stage, Ubercarry is heavily recommended. Most non-ubercarry strats are
        impractical. If you're interested in beating it uberless for whatever reason, boosted Jamieras and Islands are
        the way to go. If you don't have those, Dark Lazer gets the job done as well.

    <p>
        Talented Dark Lazer is mandatory, although you won't be spamming her all the time as you might be used to. Rich
        Cat is needed to sustain her because this stage is stupid cash tight. Sniper is also needed to get Daboo off of
        your base, and helps to delay his attacks in general. Pizza works because it's pizza, and Roe is basically the
        only meatshield / wall that you wave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try and play conservative. Dark Lazer can drain your money super quickly if you aren't careful. Save up your
        money for Bahamut during the Angel waves, and your Holy Blast for the Zombie waves [first Zory doesn't count].
        As long as you're above 10k cash when no peons are around, you should be fine. When they do spawn send pretty
        much everything that you have. Balancing between saving ground and saving money is the key to this stage.
    </p>


    <h4 id="march-to-death">Dead by Encore > March to Death</h4>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage starts off with a few Metal One Horns for cash. About a minute in Daboo spawns, accompanied by some
        Metal Doge. Metal Doge continue to deploy throughout the stage at a gradual rate. Eventually, a couple Super
        Metal Hippoes spawn, followed by a Sir Metal Seal after some more time. The combination of Metal enemies and
        Omni Pushers is very lethal, and this stage is a prime example of it.
    </p>
			
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Crazed Moneko</b> - Crit Up M combo raises crit rate of your attackers by 2%, which is very helpful.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Waitress / Soba</b> - Deals solid damage to the Sir Metal Seal, and also to Super Metal Hippoe.
            Guaranteed crit is also valuable here.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Puppetmaster / Mochi</b> - Disposable CC. Enemies will push like hell without them.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Talented Cameraman</b> - AoE Crit can be humongously helpful for the Super Metal Hippoes. A crit from
            Cameraman can take off anywhere from 60% [at level 40] to 100% [at level 69] of the SMHs HP.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Noodle</b> - Good ranged meatshield, occasionally kills Metal Doge.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Catyphoon</b> - Great for clearing up Metal Doge, but the cooldown is rather long.

    <p>
        Crit Up combo is pretty much compulsory to get Cameraman crits. Manic Jamiera can be substituted for Bahamut,
        but both are decent. Holy Blast is ideal for this stage, unless you have a levelled Waterblast for whatever
        reason. Catasaurus is also a functional critter, but not really recommended here. Alternative approach with
        talented Riceball is seen <a href="https://youtu.be/mWjL5ml-zhs" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Start off with Waitress, then send Crazed Moneko after a bit of a delay. Afterwards spam Manic Eraser and
        Noodles, along with Catornado. These should take care of the Metal One Horns and bring in some money. Try to get
        Manic Jamiera / Awakened Bahamut in before the Super Metal Hippoe arrive to deal some damage to Daboo.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the SMH arrive, stop spamming Noodle and Catornado, as they'll only prolong the fight. Waitress and
        Cameraman will be reliable, and no harm in sending CMoneko along with them. Send Puppetmaster and / or Mochi for
        Crowd Control, and try and time your faster units. If you're lucky, you'll land a Cameraman crit and make the
        fight much easier. Try to use a well-timed Holy Blast here to buy you some time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the Sir Metal Seal phase, you'll probably be fighting real close to your base. This is okay, and it makes
        timing a bit easier too. Cameraman isn't super reliable here, but if you have the money you can send her anyway.
        Waitress will be a consistent source of good damage, and you can always try your hand with C. Moneko [and even
        regular Moneko] here. This is a "Do or Die" sort of situation so you want to send everything you got.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the SMS is dead, you should have a clear win. Bringing Rich Cat is mandatory for this stage, and Sniper is
        helpful for the cleanup [but far from needed]. Unfortunately, this stage is <i>very heavily</i> RNG dependent,
        and can waste a ton of Rich Cats [I speak from experience]. Be prepared to sink some resources here if you're
        not boosted.

    <hr>


	<h4 id = "saintly-sister">Papuu's Paradise > Saintly Sister</h4>

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Heavenly Herald Papuu [Angel] deals 4000 Damage per hit, with 40% extra toxic damage on top of it. With her
        tremendous omni range, she'll be almost always hitting your base. She strengthens to 3x at 30% HP, becoming much
        more deadly. She also has immunities to every negative effect except curse and sniper, both of which greatly
        debilitate her.
    </p>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage is relatively short, and Papuu spawns nearly immediately; followed by two sir rels. Following this,
        there are a few peon waves with weak Dagshunds and Wall Doges. After three Dagshunds and a few Sir Rels, the
        peon flow mostly stops, allowing you to get clean hits on Papuu. Overall, a very easy stage with the right
        lineup and approach.
    </p>

    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can</b> - Big damage, one shots sir rels at level 41 or higher. Also great for killing basically
            every other peon, and survives two papuu hits.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bullet Train</b> - Secondary Sir Rel killer. Works great to kill peons when they're close to your base,
            or to snipe them while papuu is attacking.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Manic Island</b> - Great for killing peons. Survives two Papuu hits, and has enough endurance to tank a
            sir rel hit. Deals great damage too.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Great for damaging Papuu quickly, especially if you're bringing curseblast.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Talented Riceball</b> - A little bit more bulk than Manic Eraser, plus toxic immune. Great for the stage
            if you can afford the NP.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Slime</b> - Not the most accessible unit for this stage, but a great pick. Big wave damage good for
            killing peons [obviously].
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Ramen</b> - Great bulk for tanking Papuu hits, and good for chipping her when peons aren't around.

    <p>
        Base Defense Combo allows you to survive Papuu hits for longer, especially if your base isn't fully upgraded. If
        you don't need it then you can try an Attack Up combo instead. Green Shell can be swapped out for Eraser, both
        are decent here. Ramen is also a staple for this stage, but I chose to not bring it. Curseblast and Bahamut are
        mandatory for this setup. There's another lineup with no sniper and Pizza instead of Slime in the video, you can
        check that out if you want.
    </p>
	
    <p>
        Use Manic Eraser to bait out a Papuu hit, and lure Sir Rel close to your base. Wait out the first Dagshund, lure
        it to base, and kill it with whatever you have. Now that you have a gap, send Bahamut. Use Curseblast to take an
        extra hit, and utilise Shell / BTrain to protect your Bahamut from Sir Rel/s. Sniper will also help you do extra
        damage if you have it. Rinse and Repeat. If you have enough base HP [which you should if you didn't let any
        enemies hit your base], send the second bahamut after the last Dagshund, and just after Papuu falls into
        strengthen range. At this point, it should be an easy win.

        King Wahwah stands at 600 range with omni-strike up till 1000. He deals 24000 damage per attack cycle
        distributed into three equal multi-hits. He has a million HP with 25 KBs, making him relatively easy to knock
        back [if you can reach him]. All his attacks have guaranteed KB effect. Lastly, he's pretty slow, with just 5
        Speed.
    </p>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>

        The stage features Wahwah with minimal peons. These include Scissoroo, Zang Roo, Shadow Boxer K, Ottas, and some

        An incredibly straightforward stage. Kill peons and live. You shouldn't have any trouble lasting till the end of

    <h4 id="wrath-of-the-dogelord">King Wahwah's Return > Wrath of the Dogelord</h4>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        This stage focuses on a peon-spam approach, similar to CotC Broton. Kroxos, Mr. Angels, Ginger Snache, Trolly
        Bloggers, and Brollows can be seen in the enemy roster.
    </p>
			
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Slime</b> - Insanely good for clearing peons, especially if boosted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Slapsticks / Seafarer / Pizza</b> - Stackable and affordable AoE DPS with enough bulk to take a beating
            form Wahwah.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Cyborg</b> - Fast enough to work [unlike Cameraman], decent range, decent damage, stackable. Cost isn't
            an issue as the stage has basically infinite money.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Talented Cyberpunk</b> - Can come in clutch towards the end, by slowing Wahwah while you're fighting
            Brollows.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bullet Train</b> - Excellent for keeping Wahwah pinned to base in startoff and fetching some money. Fails
            later on due to the peon spam nature of the stage, though.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Green Shell</b> - Knockback immunity allows it to stall Wahwah for some time.
        </li>
    </ul>
			
    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Kasa Jizo:</b> Kasa Jizo.
        <li><b>LD / Wave attackers:</b> Cats in the Cradle, D'artanyan, etc.
    </ul>

    <p>
        Use Bullet Train to pin Wahwah in the startoff and get some cash. When the Mr. Angels come out, start sending
        your attackers and meatshields. Afterwards, it's more or less a CPU strat. Keep your Cyberpunk saved for when
        you're pushed to your base. Bring Thunderbolt to enable slime to land hits more consistently, and keep an eye on
        your money. This is a straightforward stage, although not that easy with low levels.

    <h3 id="wanwan"><u>Everlord Wanwan</u></h3>
    <hr>


    <h4 id="dogsville">Wanwan's Glory > Dogsville</h4>

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Everlord Wanwan has omni and multihit, with the same build as Lord Wahwah. The difference being, his third hit
        carries a one-minute long warp instead of knockback; and does only 750 damage.
    </p>
		
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage starts off with Wanwan immediately, followed by some Relic Doge. Around a minute in, one
        Capy spawns. Another Capy spawns some while later. Peons include Relic Doge, Sir Rels, Croconators,
        and Mistress Celeboodles. This stage has a cat limit of only 10, which is challenging because of Wanwan's warp.
        It limits your meatshielding ability, and makes the enemies push more. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for
        this stage.
    </p>

    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Great for damaging Capy IF you're not using any other uber for the same job.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Slime</b> - Can knock back Wanwan from a distance. Great at getting him off your base, especially when
            fighting Capies. Also chips hordes of peons much better than other options [if timed well].
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can</b> - One-shots Sir Rels at level 41, and deals solid damage to Relic Doge. Tanks a lot of damage
            and repositions frequently. On top of that, he has warp immunity, making him phenomenally useful here.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Manic Lion</b> - Fast attack rate is great for killing Croconators. Preferred over crit units because of
            his short cooldown, and ability to act as a secondary meatshield.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bullet Train</b> - Great for getting peons off your base if they're putting pressure [especially Sir
            Rel].
        </li>
    </ul>
		
    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>NEO Cutter</b> - Does big damage to Capy if it can land a strengthened hit. Even one strengthened hit can
            make your life much easier, especially for the second Capy. You can also use it for combo kills on Sir Rels
            with BTrain / Slime, but this is not recommended outside of emergencies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent, preferably Max Survivor)</b> - Can slow Wanwan for a distance, which can
            stall him for long if followed up with a knockback from Slime [or from Cyberpunk's own damage]. You can also
            use him to slow down Capy and fight a bit far from the base. Whichever way you choose to use him, he's a
            great pick for this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Catellite</b> - Warp Immune meatshield that helps to keep cat limit empty. Can also clear Those Guys,
            which helps your other units [Can Can / BTrain] miss less often.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Lineups and Strategies</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Note:</u> There are cheese strats for this stage using either Healer or Seafarer. You should avoid these,
        because the setups are too elaborate and RNG reliant / need immensely difficult timing.

    <p>
        Just a heads up, this guide uses Jiangshi, both with and without talents, in different lineups. If your Jiangshi
        isn't talented using Catellite is just as good. Jiangshi is a decent pick because high speed, and because he
        saves Cat Limit thanks to survivor. The stage isn't too cash-intensive either. Pizza and Can Can are there for
        general DPS, and the rest of the lineup is obvious. There's another lineup with NEO Cutter in this video, refer
        to that if you have the unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        This does have some timings to master. Immediately send Bullet Train, don't even upgrade worker. After BTrain
        hits base you can upgrade worker to 2 [but not 3]. As soon as Wanwan spawns, send Manic Eraser and Can Can, in
        that order. When BTrain recharges, deploy MEraser. as soon as MEraser recharges, send BTrain again [this is just
        for timing, so that BTrain hits Wanwan after his first multi-hit]. Ideally it will hit Wanwan and get warped,
        but if it doesn't hit him that's okay too.
    </p>
    <p>
        After this point, lure the enemies. Handle the peons as you want, just make sure you don't push too far from
        your base. When the Capy comes, use Bahamut to damage him, and send the other damagers that you've brought. If
        all goes well, both the warped bullet trains will arrive and interrupt Wanwan, buying you time to rush Capy.
        This is a very chaotic stage, so you might not get immediate results even with the correct approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        In between Capies, you should try to gain ground. Push back Wanwan with well-timed slimes, Can Can, Bullet
        Train, and Manic Lion. You can send Cyberpunk here, or when the second Capy comes. When the second Capy comes to
        the field, send everything that you got. It's tough, but once that's done the stage is over. Remember to
        prioritise getting as many Slime hits as possible. They knock back Wanwan, deal good damage to all peons, and
        buy you time for other units to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
        More important than WHAT to do in Wanwan, is WHAT NOT to do. There are many pitfalls in this stage, and even
        expert players will fall for them from time to time. Without go into too much detail, remember these few points.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do NOT send Slime unless Wanwan has just finished attacking, it will just die.</li>
        <li>Do NOT spam all meatshields rapidly. You will clog up the Cat Limit.</li>
        <li>Do NOT panic. Everyone makes mistakes, and with Slime it isn't too tough to recover from them.</li>
        <li>Do NOT be impatient. If you spam everything, there's a good chance some of your units will get warped.</li>
        <li>
            Do NOT let the Sir Rels live. Prioritise killing them as quickly as possible, through whatver damage combo
            you can get. Reserve Bullet Train / Green Shell for them if you need to. They will tear through your
            meatshields if you're not careful.
        </li>
    </ul>

        Uses Manic Island for killing peons, a perfectly acceptable alternative to Pizza. Both of them have a tendency
        to get warped, but Manic Island's fast attack rate and solid DPS make him a great pick for this stage. It uses
        only a single Bullet Train warp, which is a bit easier to time. Other than that, the basic principle and
        strategy is the same as the previous lineup.

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Cruel Angel Clionel stands at 600 range, with an LD reach of 400~1200. She deals 32000 Damage in a single hit,
        and attacks every 4.8s. She has 2.4M HP with just 4 KBs. While her blindspot is large, she's almost always
        featured with support enemies which fill it up, making her a forbidable foe.
    </p>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage features the deadly duo of Clionel and Sleipnir. Clionel's blindspot of 400 is almost completely
        covered by Angelic Sleipnir, leaving no safe zone for any cats. This makes the combo difficult to fight without
        any specific strategy. Additionally, there are Trolly Bloggers who can push your units into Clionel's range, and
        Angelic Gories who plow through your defenses.
    </p>

    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Awakened Bahamut is a must-have for rushing the Angelic Sleipnir.</li>
        <li><b>Ramen</b> - Almost mandatory for stalling Angels, especially the Angelic Gory waves.</li>
    </ul>
	
    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Maglev</b> - Snipes Trolly Bloggers for good money, and rebounds on Sleipnir KB, great for chipping it in
            the startoff.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Manic Macho Legs / Medalist</b> - Good for cleaning up Trolly Bloggers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can, preferably with Double Bounty</b> - Good damage on Angelic Gories.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Seafarer / Pizza</b> - Also for Angelic Gories. Note that Seafarer's Speed and Survivor ability make him

        Attack and Defense combos can be replaced with Resist combos if you don't have the needed units. Base Defense
        combos are usable here as well. Alternatively, you could try Manic Eraser / Zamboney / Seafarer instead of
        those. Level 40s are <i>heavily</i> recommended. Can Can and Pizza talents are great to have as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Send off a lone MML to kill Bloggers for money. If you've brought Crazed Cow you can use it here as well. When
        Sleipnir moves in front of Clionel send Maglev. If you're lucky, you'll get 3-4 hits out of Maglev, which will
        seriously injure Sleipnir. Lure the Angelic Gory, and rush it down with Bahamut. The stage proceeds similar to
        the original No Plan A afterwards, but the cat limit makes it considerably tighter. Use Seafarer instead of Can
        Can if yours is missing a lot.

        Manics with lower levels could work, but Zamboney / Roe are mandatory. Needless to say, Ramen works well in
        place of Mohawk too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stall out the two waves of Relic Doge in the startoff however you want. Lucas uses Cameraman here, I prefer Can
        Can and Maglev. Stall for a while, then send Roe and Zamboney. Send Bahamut just before Zamboney can hit base,
        and Maglev with him. Timing is essential here, so pay close attention to the video.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fire Slow Beam on base hit. Do note that Iron Wall can work as well, but it's not mentioned as no one has a
        levelled Iron Wall. Maglev should hit the Gabriel in the boss wave, making way for Bahamut and Zamboney to enter
        Clionel's blindspot. If done right, this should be an easy win from here. Keep spamming meatshields and tanks.

	<h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Death Angel Z-Onel retains the LD reach and attack cycle of Clionel, but now has the Zombie trait instead. She
        also revives infinite times at 50% HP, and has 1M base HP.This means that she can be quite troublesome if you
        can't Z-Kill her.
    </p>

	<h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        Features 2 Z-Onels, paired with Zuche, Zoge, Star Peng, Shibalien Elite, and General Gregory. 1500% CotC
        crystals are mandatory for this stage.
    </p>

	<h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Very helpful for rushing down the first Z-Onel, which makes the stage considerably
            easier.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Slime</b> - Disposable attacker who can take out Zuche and Zoge conveniently, and helps for chip on
            tankier peons as well.
        </li>
        <li><b>Bullet Train</b> - For killing Zuche before they fuck up your everything.</li>

	<h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>A Well-levelled Holy Blast</b> - Z-Kill snipe strat uses level 18~20 Holy Blast, Li'l Flying / Chadbear
            strat uses level ~10. Even higher levels are achievable, and the more levelled your cannon is the easier
            this stage gets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can / Chill / Seafarer</b> - All are good at dealing with the Starred Aliens, but you might not have
            enough slots for all three.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Li'l Flying / Cadaver Bear</b> - Allow you to get Z-Kill on Z-Onel if you're not using Holy Blast Snipe

    <p>
        Seafarer and Can Can's Alien CC Talents are both grea to have here, but not compulsory. You might want Chill
        Cost Down if trying richless, especially since it's used on Puffer Planet as well. Boosted Manic Island isn't
        that common, you could try Li'l Flying / Cadaver Bear or talented Housewife there instead [even Dancer or Ubers
        can work]. Holy Blast Level 15+ is mandatory for this lineup, 18+ is recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
        Start off by luring the Zoge. Kill it and a Zuche with Slime. Lure the Star Peng to your base, then stack
        attackers on it. By the time Z-Onel comes, the Aliens should be dead. Send Bahamut now. From here on out, it's a
        number guessing game. Wait for a bit after Z-Onel's third KB, then fire Holy Blast. If you did it right, you
        should get a Z-Kill. From here on out, you can improvise, and the video goes more in-depth on that.

        This strat works well even with a level 10-12 Holy Blast, but it needs either Li'l Flying Cat [Level 60+
        recommended], or Cadaver Bear Cat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Startoff is almost identical to the above strategy. After dealing with the Star Peng, use Holy Blast to make way
        for your Li'l Flying stack to enter Z-Onel's blindspot [It's too slow to enter normally]. Afterwards, you kinda
        just pray that Flying gets the Z-Kill. A higher level Li'l Flying helps. The rest can be improv'd from there on.

    <h4 id="bombergirl">Deeply Dreaming > Bombergirl</h4>

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Bakoo is a Black enemy with 180 standing range, an LD attack ranging from 50 to 1850, freeze with 177% uptime, a
        2.83s attack frequency, and 10000 damage. To compensate, she has a very low 4 Speed, and 500k HP with 10 KBs
        [putting her at a relatively low endurance of 50k].
    </p>
	
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        A Bore spawns in the startoff. When you hit the base, Bakoo is deployed; along with a Kang Roo and a Bore. Some
        Wall Doge follow after, and another Bore spawns after some while.
    </p>
	
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>iCat</b> - Allows guaranteed and effective crowd control for the Bores. With him you can use them as LD
            stepping stones to kill Bakoo.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Medalist / Vaulter / Cyborg</b> - Any decent LD unit works really, but these two are great. You could
            always try Cyborg as well. These will help you to chip Bakoo [and hopefully KB her before she attacks your
            stack].
        </li>
    </ul>

        BioBone allows you to get 2 iCats in time if your base HP is low. Otherwise very straightforward lineup.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lure the Bore close to your base. Send iCat and Crazed Tank. Bore will knock back your iCat once it unfreezes,
        then you can stall it on your base. Wait till the second iCat. Once two iCats are out, you'll have permafreeze.
        Stall for money if you want, then start stacking Cyborgs. Once the Bore dies, your iCat stack will hit the base.
        Fire cannon when this happens to cancel Bakoo's attack. After that, just watch the magic.

        Disallowed Rarities: Special, Super Rare. Allowed Rarities: Normal, Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. No longer
        having access to iCat or Roe forces a different strategy. While the general idea is the same [CC Bore/s, stack
        LD / Cyborg], it becomes less consistent in execution.
    </p>
	
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>

        Catley is brought for crowd control. Thaumaturge won't hit much in the startoff but can be useful during the
        boss fight. Enchantress is not used because her proc sucks lmao. Bring Zamboney if you have it.
    </p>
	
    <p>
        Lure the Bore close to base, but not quite hitting. Keep 2-3 Catleys on the field to maintain a stable
        frontline, then build a stack. If Bore isnt dead but you're close to the enemy base, stop spawning everything
        and let them die; then start over. Rinse and repeat till the Bore dies, then hit the base. If everything goes
        right, you'll win. While this strat is quite RNG dependent, it's the best accessible approach we've got.

        Eraser is only brought for the startoff. Bahamut is used at 36 in the video but 30 is perfectly usable. Pizza
        Wave, Cameraman Survivor, and Can Can Double Bounty talent are highly recommended. While Seafarer Freeze Up did
        not exist back then, it's definitely phenomenal here. Legs are optional. Savage Blow on Housewife is good to
        have too, but far from compulsory. Avoid any short ranged unit unless it has piercing or is Yukimura.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lure the first Doge Dark to your base, and kill it with can can for good money. Send out Seafarer and Bomber to
        stall for a bit, then clear out the Doge with Pizza. Keep spamming Cameramen and Bombers, save up some money for
        Bahamut. Once the Gory Blacks are dead, you'll have some respite. The Shadow Boxers are threatening as well, but
        you should have some money and a good stack by then. Use cannon to interrupt Bakoo's attacks if needed.

    <p>
        Doremi has the same LD range as Bakoo, but is traitless. Additionally, she's considerably faster (14 as opposed
        to Bakoo's 4), and has higher endurance, much more damage, and a slow instead of freeze proc.
    </p>

	<h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        Startoff consists of an Alpacky with some Mr. Angels for support. After base hit, Doremi spawns with Trolly
        Bloggers, Mr. Angels, and Director Kurosawah as support.

        clear later. Base Defense combos if you're poor. Attack Up combos also work well here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kill Alpacky and stall for max cash. Then hit the enemy base. Lure Doremi to your base, and send Bahamut. Before
        Doremi launches her next attack, Bahamut will hit her again. After 20 some repeats, Doremi is dead. GG. See

        Hannya is a red variant of The Face, with an enormous 800 range. She also cripples all units to 25% Attack with
        her weaken, and has an attack frequency of 5s. She deals 36k damage with one attack, which can one-shot many
        units, including Awakened Bahamut.
    </p>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        Hannya spawns almost immediately on a timer, followed by a Bore. About a minute later, R. Ost spawns, and these
        two enemies keep cycling. Ginger Snache are sent intermittently, with Sir Seals appearing as well later on.
    </p>
	
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - Awakened Bahamut is used against either Hannya or R.Ost, depending upon the
            strategy. Either way, he's a mandatory unit.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ICat</b> - Mandatory for the rush strat, great to have for regular approach too. Makes stalling the Bore
            easy, and can permafreeze Hannya when stacked. Speed is a bit of an issue, but this can be fixed with Speed
            / Research combos or Speed Up talent.

        BioBone helps to rush down the Bore quickly, and allows you to get more iCats, which means more chance of
        permafreeze lasting for the full rush. The rest of the lineup should be self-explanatory. The playlist also has
        lineups with Freeze Up combos, Speed Up combos, and a setup without Sushi. Alternatively, you can try your luck
        with <a href = "https://youtu.be/L1HdKqJE5ag" target = "_blank">iCat Speed Up talent</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lure the first Bore up close, throw everything you got at him except Bahamut. The Bore should die just before
        Hannya gets up close, and your Sushis will take a hit. After that, you should get a permafreeze from iCat, and
        you can start Bahamut chaining. If all goes well, Hannya will be dead before the R. Ost arrives. You can use
        Thunderbolt cannon to stall her if she unfreezes, and the Weaken from Sushi will allow your units to tank a hit
        from her, if needed.

    <p>
        Allowed Rarities: Normal, Special, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: Rare, Super Rare. This makes the
        stage considerably tougher, since a lot of the units you rely on are Rares and Super Rares [iCat, Roe, Elemental
        Duelist, Crazed Whale]. There are two distinct ways of beating this stage. One is having decently levelled
        Normals, and the other is Ubercarry. Most people stick with the latter.

    <h5>Must-Have Units [Uberless, no EX Talents]</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Awakened Bahamut</b> - For rushing down R. Osts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Boosted Island</b> - Anti-Red tank / DPS. Stops the Bore from shredding your frontline since you don't
            have access to Manic Eraser. Also good for chipping Hannya, even through weaken.
        </li>
        <li><b>Boosted Eraser</b> - Meatshield.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Boosted Li'l Island</b> - Same purpose as Island, but needs slightly higher levels as it has less base
            stats.

    </ul>
	
    <h5>Talented EX Alternatives</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Dark Lazer</b> - Attack and Defense are must-have, Wave talent is almost necessary, but Weaken Immunity
            works too.
        </li>
        <li><b>Ultimate Bondage</b> - Only needs Defense up talent. Can substitute Islands after this.</li>

    </ul>
	
    <h5>Lineups and Strategies</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Note:</u> All the approaches to this stage are a bit high-investment. The talents which you use here
        [Bondage HP/ DL Talents] are expensive, and farming Islands to +30 or such won't give you massive return for the
        energy investment either [by 2021 progression standards]. Ubercarry relies on having one of a particular set of
        ubers, so it isn't super accessible. No matter which approach you choose, expect to go out of your way while
        making a lineup for this stage.

    <p>
        The Strong Up Sm + M / Defense Up Sm combo allow both Islands to take a hit from Hannya without flinching. This
        is great for maintaining a stable frontline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Send Islands only in the startoff to kill off the Bore. Try and keep Hannya away from your base. Lure R. Ost and
        Bahamut chain it. If you wish to chain on your base clear off Ginger Snache first. If you can't kill it in a
        single chain then chip with Dragons or other ranged units. Stall between Bore and R. Ost waves with Islands. Use
        erasers for R. Ost. Try and Bahamut chain it if you can. Rinse and repeat till Hannya dies. Curseblast can be
        good to bring here too, but Breakerblast / Thunderbolt work just as well.
    </p>

    <p><b><u>Talented Dark Lazer Strat</u></b></p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write(lineup(['30-2-150', '30-2-18', '30-2-19', '30-2-52', '30-2-11', '30-2-25', '30-2-1', '40-2-13', '30-2-21', '40-2-6']))

    <p>
        Research and Strong combos are similar in effect. If you have the Seasons of Love combo I'd definitely recommend
        that. Dark Lazer has Attack, Defense, and Wave talents. Nothing else is talented. Add talented Bondage if you
        can afford it. Riceball is only for occasionally baiting Hannya hits, I wouldn't recommend it for meatshielding
        if untalented. Curseblast is used to let Dark Lazer temporarily hit Hannya unweakened.
    </p>
    <p>
        The video description goes in-depth on the approach, but I'll summarise it here. Start off by spamming Lasers
        till the first Bore dies. Wait out the first R. Ost and a Ginger Snache wave that comes just after it. Then lure
        R. Ost to your base and Bahamut chain it [see exact proceudre in video]. Use what you must for the second Bore
        [I use Ninja as a filler meatshield but it isn't needed if you've brought Island]. The second R. Ost can be
        Bahamut chained similar to the first, but now Hannya is close to your base so it's a bit more complicated.
    </p>


    <h4 id="revenge-of-carnage">River Acheron > Revenge of Carnage</h4>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage starts off with a few Znache. When you hit base, Hannya spawns; starting a few waves of Zombie peons.
        These include Zroco, Zigge, and Zir Zeal. After a couple minutes the peons die down, and you're free to take out
        Hannya.
    </p>
		
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Housewife</b> - Good range. Slow is helpful against the peons. Can get Z-Kills occasionally [much more
            potent with Savage Blow talent]
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Pizza</b> - Great mid-range DPS and cash-efficient as well. Especially great if
            you have his Wave Attack talent.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Maglev and Roe</b> - Only really there for the cleanup, which can be painfully slow without them.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Shigong</b> - To stall Zombie peons.</li>
        <li><b>Cyberpunk</b> - Provides CC from a distance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Z-Killers with good CD:</b> Li'l Valkyrie, Mighty Aethur, Sarukani, etc.
        <li><b>Low CD Melee Ubers / Rushers:</b> Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, Immortal Yukimura, Meow-sketeer, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    </script>
    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/wpU8MCc0CQM" target="_blank">Video</a></p>
    <p>
        Research Combo helps mainly for Shigong. Other units are explained above. Holy Blast helps a lot but it isn't
        necessary by any means, as the stage is relatively easy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Send a single pizza in the startoff to build up money. There's fancier setups for the startoff but this is very
        straightforward and gets the job done. You should have about worker Level 6 and 5k money in your wallet when
        hitting base. Afterwards the only real concern is money. Don't send Bahamut outside of an emergency and try to
        get Housewife Z-Kills [by not sending more of Pizza / Can Can than needed]. This helps to conserve money too. If
        the third or fourth Zir Zeal end up close to your base you can rush them down with Bahamut as well. Afterwards
        just pin Hannya with Roe and kill Zrocos with Maglev / Housewife.
    </p>



	<h3 id="kurokame"><u>Black Okame</u></h3>
	<hr>


    <h4 id="the-pure-land">Courts of Torment > The Pure Land</h4>

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Black Okame is a Red / Black variant of Hannya. And before you even try it, she is Freeze Immune. She has 320
        Standing Range with omnitstrike up till 800. With 24000 damage and a 2.1s attack frequency, she can disable most
        units that aren't tankers. Even slow bulky units like Island or Pizza struggle because of the knockback.
        Finally, she has 2.6M HP with just a single knockback, which means you aren't killing her before peons stop
        cycling [without insane Ubercarry at least].
    </p>
	
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        Okame spawns almost immediately on a timer, accompanied by a Doge Dark. Doge Dark and Ginger Snache spawn on
        cycles, along with Gory Blacks. After a couple minutes, the peons die down [there are only 5 Gory Blacks] and
        you have a free shot on Okame.
    </p>
	
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Roe</b> - Pretty much your only way of maintaining a stable frontline.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Manic Island</b> - Great for both chipping Okame, and giving you some buffer time till your Pizzas arrive
            to kill Gory Blacks. Also kill Ginger Snache on the side, and help in stalling.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Pizza</b> - Kills black peons effectively, although he gets stunlocked by Okame if no peons are around.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>NEO Cutter</b> - Can dispose of Ginger Snache immediately, and decent for chipping Okame as well.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Assassin Bear Cat</b> - Relatively fast, good chance of hitting Black peons, and deals great damage to
            them.
        </li>
        <li><b>Talented Box Cats</b> - Kill Black peons very easily.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent)</b> - Send when Okame is close to your base to gain some extra Crowd
            Control. Not much else to explain.
        </li>
        <li><b>Sniper the Deadeye</b> - Stands outside of Okame's range, and is great for regaining ground.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <span>
        <u>Note:</u> Many ubers that would otherwise have great for these traits can suffer greatly on this stage, due
        to Okame's stunlock. Watch out for anything with high Foreswing or slow Speed, because it will probably not
        work.
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Anti-Blacks [mainly for peons]:</b> Immortal Yukimura, Kasa Jizo, Legendary Musashi.
        <li><b>Anti-Black / Red KB:</b> God Emperor Raiden, Immortal Kenshin, etc. These are great for buying ground.
        <li>
            <b>KB Immune Tanks:</b> Almighty Hades, Divine Kai. These aren't fantastic here, but can definitely be
            useful for stalling Okame.
        </li>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/2f1yrkFaVMA" target="_blank">Video</a> - courtesy Kaxzer</p>
    <p>
        This lineup uses two Health Up Sm combos. I've swapped out Wrestling's combo with Cameraman's combo which has
        the same effect, but is more accessible. You could also try Resist combos if you want. Regular Island is used in
        this lineup, but I would advise against deploying it [unless yours is +30 or higher, and even in that case it's
        mediocre due to low speed]. Awakened Bahamut can come in clutch for peons, particularly Gory Black.
    </p>
	
    <p>
        Lure the first Doge Dark, and kill it for quick money. The stage is really straightforward afterwards. The peons
        are too weak for there to be any difficulty. That being said, don't bother with trying to kill Okame quickly;
        peons will die down before you do it anyway, and you'll end up wasting money. Breakerblast and Sniper are both
        must-haves, as you heavily rely on them for gaining ground. Sniper the Deadeye is also a decent unit here.

    <h3 id = "tyrant"><u>Evil Emperor Cat</u></h3>
    <hr>


    <h4 id="prelude-to-ruin">Possessed by Evil > Prelude to Ruin</h4>

    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Evil Emperor Cat has a range and attack cycle similar to Nyandam Variants. However, he also has a Level 3 Surge
        [600~900 range] with a debilitating status effect. He inflicts Freeze for 1.5s [reset by surge], and curse for
        4s. The damage from the surge isn't that much [6.7k per hit]. He has 520 standing range with omni-strike that
        goes till 620. He's somewhat fast for a Nyandam variant with 6 speed and very little backswing. He has 1.2M HP
        and 8 KBs, so he's relatively easy to push back if you have a clean hit.
    </p>
		
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage starts off with Emperor almost immediately. Sir Seals, Ginger Snache, Sir Rels, and two Capies feature
        as peons early on. After some time, Oldhorn appears as the final threat. Once he's down, there's no one
        protecting Nyandam and you have an easy win.
    </p>
		
    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Slime</b> - Can damage Emperor from a distance. Also great for chipping Sir Seals / Capies while the
            Oldhorn is at front.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Can Can</b> - One shots Sir Rels at level 41 or higher, and deals good damage to Ginger Snache too.
            Overall a great pick because of solid survivability and damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Manic Island</b> - Works for roughly the same reasons that Can Can does. The boosted DPS against Red
            enemies also helps against Capy / Sir Seal.
        </li>
    </ul>
		
    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Slapsticks</b> - Very helpful against Oldhorn if your Can Can / Manic Island aren't levelled enough to
            take it down by themselves.
        </li>
    </ul>
		
    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Melee / Rushers:</b> Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle, Gravolodon.

    <p>
        [No items used, but Rich Cat helps.] BioBone increases the efficacy of Can Can, Manic Island, and Slime. Dual
        erasers are used here, and you should stick with regular Eraser even if yours isn't very high levelled. Rest of
        the units were explained earlier. Awakened Bahamut is decent for chipping Capy but you have to time him right. A
        well-timed cannon cancel can also help your Bahamut survive longer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lure the Sir Rel / Ginger Snache to your base, and try to get Double Bounty on them. Afterwards, keep the fight
        as far from your base as possible. This will give more ground to deal with the Oldhorn later. Try and time your
        slimes to avoid Emperor's surge. This takes a bit of practice but can be great once you have it working. Can Can
        / Manic Island should deal with the enemies just fine, especially if they're boosted. Slapsticks don't help much
        here, so don't send them. Send Awakened Bahamut somewhere around the second Capy to chip it down.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the Oldhorn spawns, you should have one Capy dead and at least one KB on the second Capy. If your units are
        boosted / you played really well, you can get even the second Capy down by now. However, this is not a
        requirement. You should also have Emperor pushed back to the enemy base. From here on out, send pretty much
        everything, and pay extra attention to timing your Slimes. Your Bahamut might recharge towards the end of this
        fight, but you might not have enough money to send him. If your units are levelled enough and your timing / luck
        are decent, the Oldhorn should be down before your base is being hit. If so, congratulations, you've won.

    <h4 id="guided-by-currents">Top of the Bog > Guided by Currents</h4>


    <h5>Boss</h5>
    <p>
        Kappy stands at 230 range, and deals a devastating 38k damage with each attack. To make matters worse, he has a
        Level 1 Surge [150~750 range]. He has a decent foreswing [40f], and it's not too difficult to make him miss. If
        you do lose your stack though, he's going to push a lot due to his 14 Speed. He's traitless, and takes quite a
        long time to kill [2M HP, 6 KBs].
    </p>
		
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        The stage features Kappy, paired with a few Scissoroos and Thrillerz. The startoff has a lone Scissoroo with
        some Thrillerz. On base hit, Kappy spawns with two Scissoroos and some Thrillerz. Scissoroos respawn regularly
        from now on, and Thrillerz cycle quickly.
    </p>

    <h5>Stage Restriction</h5>
    <p>
        Allowed Rarities: Normal, Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: EX, Super Rare. Guides for both the
        regular and wrath stage are merged, as they both can use the same lineup.
    </p>

			<h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
				<p><b>Stone</b> - Great for stalling Kappy. Stone-less strategies exist, but I wouldn't recommend them.</p>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Slime / Tourist / Crystal</b> - Only necessary for stone-less setups.</li>
        <li><b>Pizza</b> - Cost-effective bonus damage on top of Cameraman.</li>

    <p>
        3 x Research up Sm combos sync Stone's respawn cycle exactly with Kappy's attack cycle. This allows you to set
        up a continuous cycle of making Kappy miss. There are stone-less strats too, but they're less consistent [and
        typically need level 50 Cameraman or higher]. Cameraman is also great on this stage, as it acts as a ranged
        meatshield. Scissoroo hitting Cameraman makes Kappy miss, preserving the rest of your stack. For the regular
        stage, you could try Housewife / Seafarer / Pizza in remaining slots. You can also save up some slots by
        swapping the research combos with uber equivalents [Sm + M or L research combos have the same effect as 3 x Sm
        combo]. Crystal can work as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stall Scissoroo in the startoff with meatshields. Once you have money, stack Cameraman. After Scissoroo dies,
        hit the enemy base. Try and have stone land on Kappy during his backswing. This way, you'll set up a cycle of
        Kappy missing. Keep spamming Stone and send Cameraman as long as you have money. If done well, you'll have a win
        from here. Thrillerz and Kappy knockbacks can cause interruptions to your Stone rhythm, so you'll need to reset
        on those. Overall, less complicated than it sounds on paper.
    </p>


    <h4 id="water-conservancy">Top of the Bog > Water Conservancy</h4>

    <h5>Stage Design</h5>

        Instead of on base hit, Kappy spawns on a timer in this stage. He's accompanied by Loris and Owlbrows, with
        Relic Doge and Trolly Bloggers for further support.
    </p>

    <h5>Must-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Stone</b> - Great for same reasons as the previous stages.</li>
        <li><b>Fishman / Talented Housewife / Medalist</b> - Good for clearing Owlbrows.</li>
        <li><b>Slapsticks</b> - Deals with Relic Doge, and has good survivability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Talented Cyberpunk</b> - Crowd Control can be useful, and he has good survivability, but you might not
            have the slots for him.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Idi</b> - <i>Incredibly</i> Situational, but could kill Loris a hell lot faster if you time her right.
            Doron also works but you probably won't have him here.

        Rich Cat is highly recommended, although not used in the video. Same drill as the previous stage. Timing Stone
        is a bit easier here, as you're fighting closer to the base and don't have Thrillerz to worry about. Lure close
        to the base, stack Slapsticks / Housewife, and watch the magic happen. The stage has a tendency to collapse on
        you if you make any mistakes, so watch out for that. You might need to let your stack die to restart the stone
        rhythm, and that's okay.

    <p>
        Puffsley's Comet has a similar build to Brollow, with big damage [40k], full backswing cooldown, and a high KB
        count [400]. It has 900k HP, with a standing range of 200 and omni-strike till 500. It also has a guaranteed
        chance to Knockback all units, although this isn't very relevant as there are few cats with above 40k endurance.
    </p>
	
    <h5>Stage Design</h5>
    <p>
        Puffsley's Comet spawns 20 seconds in. It's followed by the first Star Peng. The stage features many more Star
        Pengs at a rapid respawn rate, along with Three Corporal Weylands and a Project A. After some time the Star
        Pengs die down, giving you a clean shot at Puffsley. The win-condition of this stage is to outlast the onslaught
        of Star Pengs. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for this stage.

        <li><b>Talented Can Can / Seafarer</b> - Crowd Control and DPS against the Star Pengs.</li>
        <li><b>Chill with Cost Down talent</b> - DPS against Star Pengs, allows you to kill one before the next arrives.
        </li>
        <li><b>Catellite</b> - Warp Immune meatshield which stops Star Pengs from warping your defenses away. Also tanks
            a Puffsley hit at level 40 or higher.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Great-To-Have Units</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>NEO Saw</b> - Effectively a combination of Catellite, Green Shell, and Manic Island. Very cost efficient,
            and great for stalling enemies here.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Useful Uber Rare Cats</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Anti-Aliens:</b> Bazibastra, Aphrodite, Sharpshooter Saki, etc. Bonus points if they can either tank Puffsley hits or stand far enough to avoid them.
        <li><b>Disposable Rushers / Melee:</b> Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle.
    </ul>

        Aerial Recon is brought for Research Up M, and it also includes Saucers within it which is a Massive Damage Up
        Sm combo [good for Chill]. Bullet Train can deal extra damage if it gets warped, and the Double Bounty is nice
        to have. Awakened Bahamut is mostly there for cleanup, but you <i>could</i> send him for Star Pengs as well if
        you had the money [which, you most likely won't]. BioBone and Uber research combos work as well. Cyberpunk in
        top row also gives IT Crowd when combined with TTraveller [which is an accounting combo], so it can be brought.
        Seafarer isn't used here, but it's a decent pick, especially if talented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Start off with a Bullet Train to keep Puffsley temporarily pushed back. Keep spamming Catellite early on with
        Can Can. Use Chill sparsely early on to save up some money, and avoid Manic Eraser if you can. Once the Weylands
        come in, the pressure increases. Play aggressively, spam your units. There isn't much depth to this stage. If
        you play too conservatively though, the Star Pengs will pile up and demolish your defenses. Once the Pengs die
        down, you've pretty much won. There's infinite Pengs afterwards at a gradual rate, so save up some money for
        those. Besides that, use Bahamut / Can Can / BTrain for cleanup, and you'll be good to go. Note that boosting
        your Can Can / Chill makes this stage much more consistent.
