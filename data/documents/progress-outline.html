    <p>
        This document contains a rough division of parts of the game into Early, Mid and Late game activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every player will have a different experience: do not expect this to apply equally to everyone. This is based
        on the rough difficulty of things if you do not have any broken ubers and play under normal conditions. If you
        have fest exclusives or use any kind of exploits, you can probably ignore this entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things in each phase are not listed in the order you should complete them: instead, you should complete them in
        parallel, progressing more in each as you can, and feel like it, or when the content is available.
    </p>
