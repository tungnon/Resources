    <p>
        Gamatoto is a very old part of Battle Cats that has, until recently, been woefully unexplained. Attempts have
        been made with varying success and accuracy in the past, but no known treatment of the topic before this has
        made as comprehensive a study as this. This represents about six months of on-and-off work by some of the best
        analysts in the Battle Cats community.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can’t be 100% sure any of the mechanics here are perfectly accurate; datamining is often not a source of
        absolute facts, but instead a matter of guessing what the numbers mean and validating them with comparisons to
        data. Most of the results here are backed up as being statistically consistent with a test sample of some 700+
        expeditions, so we are pretty confident overall. This is the best explanation we currently have, but further
        research may change this in future.

    <p>
        The outcomes of a Gamatoto Expedition are described in the GAMATOTO Report Screen shown above.
        We begin with some observations about it.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each line is either yellow or white depending on if a drop was obtained or not.</li>
        <li>The number of lines you get depends on the expedition's length.</li>
    </ol>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Expedition Length</th>
            <th>Number of Lines</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1 hour</td>
            <td>6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3 hours</td>
            <td>18</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6 hours</td>
            <td>36</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>
            You can get different amounts of the same drop on different lines
            (e.g., Cat Food×1, Cat Food×2 ; XP+1115, XP+1050)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Other things like what the different white lines say, which Helpers' names comes up, and the time it shows for
        each line, are random choices shown for style and do not have any useful meaning.
    </p>

    <h5 id="lines-and-number-of-drops">Lines and Number of Drops</h5>
    <p>
        Each line in the GAMATOTO Report is an independent chance to get any of the potential drops in the area. First,
        the game rolls to check which item you can get on that line. The base chance to choose each item depends on the
        area. See a table of these chances in <a href="#appendix-a">Item Choice Base Rates</a>.
        For example, we can look at Traitor’s Trench:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="table-title-cell" colspan="2">Traitor's Trench</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Choice %</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>XP</td>
            <td>83%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cat Food</td>
            <td>15%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Super Rare Catseye</td>
            <td>2%</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        These probabilities always sum to 100%, as every line is assigned one of these item drops. However, there is a
        second check to determine if you actually get the item. The base chance to get an item is 32%, and it is
        increased by your Helpers (as described in <a href="#advanced-details">Advanced Details</a>). When this check
        succeeds, you get a Yellow Line and the item chosen in the previous step. If instead this check fails, you get a
        randomly generated White Line and no item.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Randomly choose which item to try for (rates depend on area)</li>
        <li>Randomly choose if you get the item or not
            <ol type="a">
                <li>32% chance of getting the item</li>
                <li>68% chance of White Line instead</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        With this, we can multiply the chance that the item is chosen with the chance of actually succeeding in getting
        it, which gives us the chance that any individual line will drop a particular item.
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="table-title-cell" colspan="4">Traitor's Trench</th>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        To then calculate the average number of drops across a whole expedition, we multiply these Drop Per Line chances
        by the number of lines you get (6, 18 or 36 depending on the length of the expedition).

        That is, the GAMATOTO Report for an average 6 hour expedition to Traitor’s Trench will have about 24 White Text
        Lines, 10 XP drops, 2 Cat Food drops, and no Catseyes, for a total of 36.
    </p>

    <h5 id="drop-amounts-and-caps">Drop Amounts and Caps</h5>
    <p>
        So when you get a drop of an item, how many do you get?
    </p>
    <p>
        This also depends on the item and area. Each item has a minimum and a maximum drop amount, and all values in
        that range are equally likely.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules for drop numbers are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cat Food always drops either 1 or 2 per line.</li>
        <li>
            Regular XP drops have a large range (e.g. 950-1150 per line) that increases as you go to higher level areas.
            These are tabulated in <a href="#appendix-b">Appendix B</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Bulk XP drops in XP Harvest Areas (e.g. XP +10,000) always drop only 1 per line.</li>
        <li>Catseyes always drop 1 per line.</li>
        <li>Battle Items drop 1 per line, except in Evangelion Areas where they drop 2 per line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using this information, taking a 3 hour expedition in Traitor’s Trench with the above data as an example, we
        find the average amount of each item dropped per expedition (multiplying the average number of successful drops
        / yellow lines by the average amount of each drop) to be:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="table-title-cell" colspan="5">Traitor's Trench <u>3h Expedition</u></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Average Yellow Lines</th>
            <th>Range</th>
            <th>Average Drop Per Line</th>
            <th>Average Drop Over Expedition</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>XP</td>
            <td>4.78</td>
            <td>950 - 1150</td>
            <td>1050</td>
            <td>5020</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cat Food</td>
            <td>0.86</td>
            <td>1 - 2</td>
            <td>1.5</td>
            <td>1.30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Super Rare Catseye</td>
            <td>0.12</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0.12</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        However, each item type in each area also potentially has a cap. If your total drops of the item exceed the cap,
        the excess will be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules for caps are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cat Food always has a cap of <b>9</b> per expedition.</li>
        <li>Regular XP drops are <b>unlimited</b>.</li>
        <li>
            Bulk XP drops in XP Harvest Areas are <b>unlimited</b>, except the highest amount in the area which has a
            cap of <b>1</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Catseyes are <b>unlimited</b>, except in Catseye Cave (and Caverns) where they have a cap of
            <b>1</b> each.
        </li>
        <li>
            Battle Items are <b>unlimited</b>, except in Collab Areas where they have a cap of <b>1</b>, or for Evangelion
            Areas <b>2</b> each.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example, if you get 5 drops of Cat Food ×2 in a single expedition, this exceeds the cap of 9, and so you
        only get 9 Cat Food from the expedition.
    </p>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
        <h5 id="inari-and-collab-helpers">Inari and Collab Helpers</h5>
        <p>
            Having Inari from the Cat Shrine present <b>doubles</b> the drop amount of items (except for Cat Food) for a
            single expedition. That is, the chance of each line dropping an item stays the same, but you get twice as
            many as usual (e.g. 2 Catseyes per line) when successful. Certain collabs (Merc, Shoumetsu, Miku) also have
            bonus helpers who act as a permanent Inari (you can’t have both at once), having the same effect on your
            drops.
        </p>
        <p>
            These also double the caps on the relevant items. (Catseye Cave can now drop <b>2</b> of each Catseye!)

    <h5 id="engineers-and-helpers">Engineers and Helpers</h5>
    <p>
        At the end of an expedition, Gamatoto has a chance to find a helper. The rates differ between Early Game and
        Regular expedition areas, defined here as:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Early Game</th>
            <td>
                Mellow Fields<br>
                Shaolin Kingdom<br>
                Dusty Desert<br>
                XP Harvest (Easy)<br>
                Grand XP Harvest (Easy)
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Regular</th>
            <td>All other normal, event and collab areas.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        The chance to find a Helper in an area depends on which of these categories you are in, the length of the
        expedition, and whether or not you have a full team of 5 Engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, the area you are in determines the Base Helper Chance:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>For Early Game areas, the Base Helper Chance is <b>7.5%</b>.</li>
        <li>For Regular areas, the Base Helper Chance is <b>9%</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Next, the expedition length determines how many Attempts Gamatoto has at finding a helper:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 hour expeditions have <b>2</b> Attempts.</li>
        <li>3 hour expeditions have <b>5</b> Attempts.</li>
        <li>6 hour expeditions have <b>9</b> Attempts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The chance of each Attempt succeeding is the Base Helper Chance above. If it succeeds, then you get a helper.
        If it fails, you move onto the next attempt and repeat. If you run out of attempts with no Helper drops, you get
        no helpers for that expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an attempt succeeds, the chance of it being each type of helper is as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Early Game</th>
            <th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineer*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
            <td>86.67%</td>
            <td>86.67%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>White</td>
            <td>9.73%</td>
            <td>7.73%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bronze</td>
            <td>2.13%</td>
            <td>3.20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Silver</td>
            <td>1.07%</td>
            <td>1.60%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gold**</td>
            <td>0.4%</td>
            <td>0.8%</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        *If you have 5 Engineers present already, you cannot get more, so the current Attempt "fails" and you move on to
        the next Attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Note that when Legendary Helpers are unlocked, you get them instead of Gold Helpers at the same rate. In other
        words, all drops that would otherwise be Gold Helpers become Legendary instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Putting all of this together, we can calculate the chance of any given expedition giving each rarity of helper:
    </p>
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/693183674887438469/876543431730659380/RecruitingHelpers.png"
         alt="Recruitng Helpers"><br><br>
    <p>
        From this, we can see that doing more <b>shorter expeditions</b> will yield more helpers on average than doing
        fewer longer ones. For example, six 1h expeditions in a regular area with full engineers will give six 0.14%
        chances at a Gold helper (average 0.84 dropped total) while one 6h expedition will yield just one 0.62% chance
        (average 0.62 dropped total) making the shorter expeditions about 35% better.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, even if you are inattentive and in a 6 hour span only manage to send out <b>four or five 1h
        expeditions</b>, this will still yield an average of 0.56 to 0.70 gold helpers, which is still slightly better
        than the 6h case.
    </p>

    <h5 id="levelling-up-gamatoto">Levelling Up Gamatoto</h5>
    <p>
        Gamatoto begins his life at Level 1, and with every expedition, gains Experience Points which allow him to level
        up. This changes the chances of choosing each item for a line and is explained in
        <a href="#effect-of-gamatoto-level">Effect of Gamatoto Level</a>. It also unlocks new areas and costumes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Higher level Gamatoto areas drop more Gamatoto Experience, tabulated in <a href="#appendix-c">Appendix C</a>,
        and longer expeditions also increase the amount as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Expedition Length</th>
                <th>Gamatoto Experience Multiplier</th>
                <th>Efficiency</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1 hour</td>
                <td>1×</td>
                <td>100%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3 hours</td>
                <td>2.75×</td>
                <td rowspan="2">92%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6 hours</td>
                <td>5.5×</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        That is, if you wish to maximise the rate at which Gamatoto gains Experience to level up, doing multiple 1 hour
        expeditions is slightly better than 3 or 6 hour expeditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, sometimes (20% chance) Gamatoto will randomly gain a bonus 50% Experience (×1.5) for expeditions.
    </p>

        The cumulative experience Gamatoto needs to reach a given level is as follows:

    <h5 id="effect-of-gamatoto-level">Effect of Gamatoto Level</h5>
    <p>
        Levelling up Gamatoto <b>increases</b> the Item Choice Rate of Cat Food, Catseyes, Battle Items and Bulk XP
        Drops (XP Harvest 10k XP, etc), while <b>decreasing</b> that of regular XP drops.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each item in each area has a "Choice Rate Modifier" which indicates how much the Choice Rate of that item
        changes for a given Gamatoto Level. To be specific:
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-purple">
        <i>
            <b>Final Choice Rate</b> = Base Choice Rate + <span class="text-danger">Choice Rate Modifier</span> ×
            <span class="text-info">Level Factor</span>
        </i>
    </div>
    <p>
        where <i>Base Choice Rate</i> is the value discussed in the <a href="#the-basics">Basics</a> section (and found
        in <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>), the Choice Rate Modifier is found in
        <a href="#appendix-d">Appendix D</a>, and the Level Factor is a number that increases as Gamatoto Levels up,
        which is given by:
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-purple">
        <i class="text-info">Level Factor = 0.02% × (Gamatoto Level - 1)</i> for Gamatoto Level 1 to 99<br>
        and<br>
        <i class="text-info">Level Factor = 2% + (0.02% × Gamatoto Level)</i> for Gamatoto Level 100+
    </div>
    <p>
        To be clear, it is 0% at Level 1, and increases by 0.02% per level until reaching 1.96% at Level 99. At Level
        100, it suddenly becomes much larger and jumps to 4%, then continues increasing by 0.02% per level.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, going back to the case of Traitor’s Trench from <a href="#lines-and-number-of-drops">before</a>,
        for a Level 100 Gamatoto:

        Note that the total chance of getting an item at all is still bound to the 32% success rate — you still get the
        same number of White and Yellow lines — increasing Gamatoto’s Level only turns some amount of your drops that
        would have previously been XP into Cat Food or other items in the area.

        We see that because the Choice Rate modifier for Catseyes is so high compared to the base Choice Rate,
        increasing Gamatoto Level to 100 effectively doubles the number you will get from expeditions in this area
        compared to Level 1 Gamatoto. Although it has a less pronounced effect on the other items, since the modifier is
        a smaller fraction of the base rate, giving you about 20% more cat food and 6% less XP. All in all, a good
        tradeoff!

    <p>
        The amount your helpers affect your Gamatoto Expeditions is dependent on the sum of your Helpers’ Scores. This
        is a number between 0 (no helpers) and 70 (ten Legendary Helpers). Each point of Helper Score adds <b>0.27%</b>
        to the <span class="text-danger">base Success Rate (32%)</span> of obtaining an item after it is selected on a
        line.
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-purple">
        <i>
            <b>Final Success Rate</b> = = <span class="text-danger">32%</span> +
            <span class="text-info">(Helper Score × 0.27%)</span>
        </i>
    </div>
    <p>
        For example, with 10 Gold Helpers, your Helper Score is <span class="text-info"> 10×6 = 60</span>, and your
        Final Success Rate is <span class="text-danger">32%</span> + (<span class="text-info">60</span> × 0.27%) =
        <b>48.2%</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that you get <b>fewer White Lines</b> and <b>more Yellow Lines</b>. Unlike the effect of increasing
        Gamatoto’s Level, Helpers actually give you more drops in total, not just shift the ratios of one drop to
        another.

    <p>
        However, there is an exception to this: Cat Food.
    </p>

    <h5 id="effect-of-helpers-on-cat-food">Effect of Helpers on Cat Food</h5>
    <p>
        The success rate for Cat Food technically increases by 0.27% per point of Helper Score too, but a second effect
        also occurs. Each point of Helper Score’s 0.27% extra chance for a Cat Food drop is cancelled out by adding a
        chance for Cat Food drops to turn into XP drops. In effect, this means that the Cat Food success rate stays at
        32%, but an extra source of XP is added to the drop table, like this:

        The Catseye drop is enhanced by both Level and Helper bonuses to be triple its base value, the Cat Food is only
        enhanced by Level, and the XP is enhanced by Helpers but decreased by Level (though still increases overall).

    <h5 id="cap-corrections">Cap Corrections</h5>
    <p>
        In the <a href="#the-basics">Basics</a> section and then later in
        <a href="#effect-of-gamatoto-level">Effect of Gamatoto Level</a> and
        <a href="#effect-of-helpers">Effect of Helpers</a>, we obtained final average amounts per expedition by
        multiplying the average number of successful lines by the average drop per line. However, as explained above,
        some items have a Cap on the maximum number you can obtain from a single expedition. While the above
        calculations are correct in the case of no cap (XP, Catseyes in regular areas...), they are inaccurate in the case
        of capped amounts (Cat Food, Catseyes in Catseye Cave...) as they do not factor it in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take for example, an <b>Imaginary Gamatoto Area</b> which only drops <b>Imaginary Catseyes</b>. Each line has a
        50% chance to drop one. In a 1 hour expedition (6 lines), you would then expect (50% × 6) or
        <b>3 Imaginary Catseyes</b> if there was <b>no cap</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if there is a Cap of 1, then clearly this is not possible. To then calculate the average, we have to
        consider the probability of <i>n</i> lines yielding a Catseye using the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution" target="_blank">binomial distribution</a>.

    <p>
        This clearly reduces the expectation value of the number of Catseyes gained per expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is only really of consequence for <b>Catseye Cave</b> where each Catseye has a cap of 1, which you will
        realistically reach often. The cap of 9 on Cat Food only very slightly affects the average Cat Food gained as
        the probability of gaining over 9 in a single expedition is low anyway. The Battle Items in collab areas, and
        the XP Harvest biggest drops are also affected by this, but are rarely used for farming.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main consequence of this is that as 1h, 3h and 6h expeditions all have the same cap, <b>six 1h expeditions
        will yield more Catseyes in Catseye Cave</b> than either two 3h expeditions or one 6h expedition on average.
        In regular areas with unlimited caps, all expedition lengths are essentially equal, but for farming Catseye Cave
        you should prioritise 1h expeditions whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exact amount of improvement doing 6×1h vs 1×6h depends on the area, your Gamatoto Level and your Helper
        Score, but for a nominal Catseye drop rate of about 2% per line, doing the six short expeditions will get you
        about 30% more Catseyes on average than a single long one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Intuitively, this is obvious from the fact that if you do six 1h expeditions each with a cap of 1, you might get
        2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 total, but the single 6h expedition still with a cap of 1 can only yield 1 or 0. Even though the
        long expedition is more likely to yield 1, the small chance that you can get more than 1 from multiple short
        expeditions outweighs the higher rates of the 6h expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
        The full analysis of this for Cat Food with a cap of 9 is much more complicated, as unlike with a cap of 1,
        there are multiple ways to achieve a cap of 9. You could get 9 drops of 1 Cat Food, or three drops of 2 Cat Food
        and three drops of 1 Cat Food, etc, and enumerating all these possibilities requires
        <a href="#appendix-e">complicated combinatorial calculations</a>.

    <hr>
    <p>
        So what is the best area to get Super Rare Catseyes? Or Cat Food?
    </p>
    <p>
        Putting together everything we’ve learned, the answer is it depends on your Gamatoto Level and Helper Score.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, for Super Rare Catseyes, the following graph illustrates the main points:
    </p>
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/709051283994312804/868957373442715678/unknown.png"
         alt="Graph"><br><br>
    <p>
        Along the x-axis is your Gamatoto Level from 1 to 116, and the y-axis is the average number of SR Catseyes
        dropped. Each shaded region represents the range of averages you can get for different Helper levels.
        Note the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            At <b>low Gamatoto Level</b>, <b>Catseye Cave (1h expedition)</b> is the best, and the Single Catseye Area
            (Traitor’s Trench) and the Multi Catseye Areas (MEGABANK etc) are about equal.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For Catseye Cave 3h or 6h, it will do worse than 1h as discussed in Cap Corrections. If you are
                    serious about optimising your Catseye drops you should not be considering these as options, but it
                    will sometimes be better, sometimes be worse, than the Single Area.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            At Gamatoto Level high but less than 100, the Single Area improves to be comparable with Catseye Cave, while
            the Multi Areas remain bad.
        </li>
        <li>For <b>Gamatoto Levels 100</b> and up, the <b>Single Catseye Area</b> becomes the best.</li>
        <li>This is only accounting for Super Rare eye drops, not other types.</li>
        <li>The Helper Level does not really matter; it affects all areas approximately equally.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The main factor here is that the Single Catseye area has a much higher
        <a href="#appendix-d">Item Choice Level Modifier</a> than the others, so the drop rate of SR Catseyes there
        increases faster with growing Gamatoto level.

    <h5 id="multiple-catseye-types">Multiple Catseye Types</h5>
    <p>
        If you are in need of <b>all types of Catseye equally</b> you get the most total drops from:
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-purple">
        <b>Catseye Cave (1h)</b> > Two-Catseye Areas > One-Catseye Areas
    </div>
    <p>
        If you need <b>two specific types of Catseyes</b> you almost always get the most drops of those two combined from:
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-purple">
        <b>Catseye Cave (1h)</b> > Two-Catseye Areas* > One-Catseye Areas*
    </div>
    <p>
        The * marks here are because there are some tiny exceptions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For the combination <b>Super+Uber</b>, it is basically equal between doing two runs of Kotatsu Tundra vs one
            each of Traitor’s Trench and Mt Parabolo if Gamatoto is Level 116. When higher levels of Gamatoto are
            unlocked, Kotatsu will become slightly worse than doing the respective One-Eye areas.
        </li>
        <li>
            For <b>Special+Uber</b>, two runs of Hidden Armory is already marginally worse than one each of Tomb of Gold
            + Mt Parabola at Level 116.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At <b>Gamatoto Levels ≥ 100</b> , the Two-Eye area is technically better or about equal but gives you fewer
        Uber/Super/Special eyes and more Rares which may not be desirable if you need many Uber eyes but only a few
        Rares for example. Doing the One-Eye areas gives you more control of what you get, and lets you get more of
        exactly what you need, so you can do <b>whichever you prefer</b> or whatever fits your needs at the time, or a
        mixture. It does not matter much.
    </p>
    <p>
        At <b>Gamatoto Levels < 100</b> the <b>Two-Eye areas win</b> by a large margin. This is because the sum of their
        Base Choice rates is far higher than the single areas, but because their Modifiers are so low (two +0.1s instead
        of one +0.56) they lose most of that advantage by high levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless, <b>Catseye Cave (1h)</b> is always the best choice for 2 or more types of eye, when it is on.

    <h5 id="optimal-use-of-catamins">Optimal Use Of Catamins</h5>
    <p>
        We can relate the value of one type of Catamins to another by how much Cat Food they cost to purchase in the
        store, even though you shouldn’t actually be wasting Cat Food on them.
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Catamin Type</th>
                <th>Cat Food Value (for 3)</th>
                <th>Cat Food / Hour</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>30</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>80</td>
                <td>8.9</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>C</td>
                <td>150</td>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        If a Catamin A is used to essentially claim a free 1h expedition, a Catamin B is used for a 3h expedition, and a
        Catamin C for a 6h expedition, which gives the highest return per Cat Food value? The more expensive Catamins
        cost less Cat Food per hour, but sometimes shorter expeditions are better, so what is most efficient?
    </p>
    <p>
        For maximising <b>Regular Drops</b> (no cap) all expedition lengths are equally profitable and so <b>Catamin
        C</b> with the lowest CF/hour rate is the best choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        For maximising <b>Gamatoto XP</b>, the low CF/hour of <b>Catamin C</b> beats the fact that you only get
        <a href="#levelling-up-gamatoto">5.5x the XP</a> from a 6h expedition compared to a 1h one, so they are again
        optimal.
    </p>
    <p>
        For maximising <b>Helper Drops</b>, the fact that you get
        <a href="#engineers-and-helpers">so many more helpers</a> from 1h expeditions compared to the others means that
        even at the higher CF/hour rate, <b>Catamin A</b> is the best choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, for capped drops in <b>Catseye Cave</b>, the balance between
        <a href="#cap-corrections">shorter expeditions being more efficient</a> and the CF/hour cost of the Catamins
        happens to be just such that <b>Catamin B</b> are slightly more rewarding than the options either side!
    </p>
    <p>
        None of these differences are too huge, and you shouldn’t be spending CF on Catamins anyway really, but a wise
        strategy for spending Catamins in the places they do better than the others might be:

        Up to three times per day, a bag will appear on the floor when Gamatoto is not away on an expedition. Opening it

    <h5 id="shrine-donations">Shrine Donations</h5>
    <p>
        Shrine appears at random around every 2-5 days, and gives you the opportunity to take a
        <a href="#shrine-fortunes">Fortune</a> for 5 XP, as well as to donate 100k, 1M, 3M or 5M XP to receive an item
        (up to 5 times each per appearance).
    </p>
    <p>
        The drop tables are:

    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/693183674887438469/876560701467004938/ShrineDrops.png"
         alt="Table"><br><br>
    <p>
        When you donate to the Shrine, it levels up depending on how much XP you’ve given it. When it reaches a multiple
        of Level 10 it disappears. It can also disappear when you leave and re-enter the Gamatoto screen at random
        (though will sometimes stay until the end of the day too).
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the above drop rates, there is a pity mechanism that every <b>30th 1M donation</b> is guaranteed
        to <b>drop a Gold Catfruit</b>. It doesn’t matter if you donate to other tiers in between, or how many shrine
        appearances you do it over. It doesn’t matter if you get a lucky 1% Gold Fruit in those 30 donations either, the
        30th will still be a Gold Fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is <b>not</b> usually recommended to donate XP to Shrine unless you already have most of your important cats
        at Level 30, at which point you may wish to use the 3M tier for Catseyes.

    <p>
        This is the probability of getting exactly S (>0) drops from n lines (6,18 or 36) with a drop chance per line of
        p (including effects of helpers and level), when they can drop 1 to D items per line with equal chance. This can
        be used to calculate expectation values for Gamatoto Areas with caps without having to enumerate all possible
        ways of reaching the cap by hand, which is tedious for caps greater than 3 or 4 (relevant for Cat Food Cap = 9).
    </p>
    <p>
        A document with the derivation of this is
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Vf1kwYS6jwAXSa7MLMaL70iFkR7Me0J" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the parameters of a 6h expedition (n=36) and Cat Food drops (D = 2) for a typical late game area and Helper
        build, you might find this predicts around 0.5% less cat food per expedition than the naive calculations which
        don’t account for cap. Thus, doing 1h expeditions to avoid reaching the Cat Food cap is rather pointless as the
        difference is minimal.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Catseye Cave with Cap = 1, the complex approach above is not required as the probability of hitting the cap
        is simply:
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-purple">
        P(1 or more drops) = 1 - P(0 drops)
    </div>
    <p>
        and the resulting expectation value is trivial (if tedious) to compute.
